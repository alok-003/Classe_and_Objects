# Classes and Objects
## Experiment 11

### Aim
To study Classes and Objects

### Theory

#### Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit. A class specifies what attributes (data) and methods (functions) its objects will have.

- **Attributes**: These are variables that belong to the class and represent the object's state.
- **Methods**: These are functions defined within the class that describe the behaviors of the object. They can modify the object's state or perform other actions.

#### Objects
An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the attributes and methods defined in the class. Each object has its own set of data and can interact with other objects and methods defined by its class.
